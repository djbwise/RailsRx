== Welcome to RailsRx, just what the doctor ordered

This is a template application. Why start from scratch when every project has the same things!

This shell app includes:
	
	* devise - for authentication
	* omniauth - for facebook/twitter etc
	* DelayedJob - background tasks, not used for every project but nice to have and doesnt hurt anyone
	* Home controller setup
	* 960 gs - css frameowrk for fast prototyping, can see the use in the header in application.html.erb

Just checkout the project
bundle install
rake db:migrate
rails s

...and all should be right in the world. Make sure to chante the facebook api keys and have your domain callback setup in the facebook application for it to work
